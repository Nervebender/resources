## üïµÔ∏è Cyber Threat Intelligence Tools

These tools help analysts triage URLs, IPs, domains, and phishing campaigns:

* **UrlScan.io** ‚Äì Submit and analyze URLs to see associated domains, IPs, technologies and screenshots. Useful for identifying malicious web indicators
  ‚Ä£ [UrlScan.io](https://urlscan.io/)

* **Abuse.ch** repositories ‚Äì Track malware samples, botnets and blocklists (e.g. ThreatFox, SSL Blacklist, URLhaus).
  ‚Ä£ [Abuse.ch](https://abuse.ch/)

* **PhishTool** ‚Äì A phishing analysis tool used to parse email headers, extract IOCs (IP, URLs), and triage inbound phishing emails.
  ‚Ä£ [PhishTool](https://phishtool.com/)

* **Cisco Talos Intelligence** ‚Äì Threat intel platform providing data on domains and IPs, ASN, reputation and malware mapping.

## üßæ YARA & OSINT Platforms
* **https://github.com/InQuest/awesome-yara** A curated list of awesome YARA rules, tools, and people.

* **https://github.com/Neo23x0/Loki** Loki - Simple IOC and YARA Scanner.

* **https://github.com/cuckoosandbox/cuckoo** Cuckoo Sandbox is an automated dynamic malware analysis system.

* **https://pypi.org/project/pefile/** pefile, Portable Executable reader module.

* **YARA** ‚Äì Rule-based tool to identify malware samples or suspicious files based on patterns in hashes, strings, metadata. Used heavily in SOC L1 for file triage.

* **OpenCTI** and **MISP** ‚Äì Threat intelligence platforms for collecting, structuring, and sharing Indicators of Compromise. OpenCTI organizes raw intel; MISP provides collaborative threat-sharing labs.

## üåê Network & Traffic Analysis Tools

These tools are central to detecting anomalies, investigating PCAPs, and writing Snort/IDS rules:

* **Wireshark** ‚Äì GUI packet capture and analysis, essential for deep-dive PCAP inspection. Used across ‚ÄúWireshark: The Basics‚Äù, ‚ÄúPacket Operations‚Äù, and Traffic Analysis tasks.
  ‚Ä£ [Wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org/)

* **TShark** ‚Äì Command-line version of Wireshark, perfect for scripted packet queries, parsing PCAPs, hex dumps, filtering via CLI.
  ‚Ä£ [TShark documentation](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html)

* **Snort** ‚Äì Signature‚Äëbased IDS/IPS for live network traffic detection and threat identification. Students write simple rules and observe alert logs.
  ‚Ä£ [Snort.org](https://snort.org/)

* **Zeek** ‚Äì Formerly Bro, Zeek processes packet captures and network traffic into detailed logs (DNS, HTTP, connections) for automated analysis.
  ‚Ä£ [Zeek.org](https://zeek.org/)

* **Brim** (now known as ZUI) ‚Äì GUI tool to explore Zeek and other log data, offering filtering and visual context for network events.
  ‚Ä£ [Brim Security](https://www.brimsecurity.com/)

* **NetworkMiner** ‚Äì Passive network forensic analysis tool for extracting hosts, sessions, files, and metadata from PCAP captures.
  ‚Ä£ [NetworkMiner](https://www.netresec.com/?page=NetworkMiner)

## üíª Endpoint Security & System Monitoring Tools

Used for investigating alerts or suspicious behavior on host systems:

* **Sysinternals Suite (TCPView, Process Explorer, Autoruns)** ‚Äì Monitor active processes, network connections, and persistent startup entries on Windows endpoints .
  ‚Ä£ [Microsoft Sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/)

* **Sysmon** ‚Äì Logs detailed system events (process creation, network activity, image loads) to aid detection via Windows Event logs and SIEM ingestion.
  ‚Ä£ [Sysmon guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)

* **osquery** ‚Äì SQL-like querying tool to inspect endpoint state (processes, packages, network, users) for threat hunting and situational awareness.
  ‚Ä£ [osquery.io](https://osquery.io/)

* **Wazuh** ‚Äì Open-source EDR/Endpoint monitoring platform that collects logs (Sysmon, auth), applies alert rules, and integrates with SIEM tools for analysis.
  ‚Ä£ [Wazuh.com](https://wazuh.com/)

## üìä SIEM & Forensics Tools (Preview / in later modules)

In later SOC Level‚ÄØ1 rooms and future extensions:

* **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** ‚Äì For indexing and visualizing logs such as VPN and authentication events. Kibana allows custom visualizations using KQL filters.
  ‚Ä£ [Elastic.co](https://www.elastic.co/)

* **Splunk** ‚Äì Splunk logs from multiple sources (IIS, Suricata, Sysmon) are trended through investigative timelines aligned with frameworks like the kill chain.
  ‚Ä£ [Splunk.com](https://www.splunk.com/)

* **Forensic tools** like **Autopsy**, **Redline**, **KAPE**, **Volatility**, and **Velociraptor** are mentioned in path extensions but more typical in SOC L2 or IR-focused rooms.
